### Text Generation, POS Tagging, Similar Word Prediction and Lemma Identification:
Under this context, I carried out data exploration besides computing Heap's and Zeph's law on a corpus of Hindi and English. By developing an automatic tagger and   word2Vec model which was used to generate text, POS, and Word Lemma tags followed by extrinsic evaluation.

### Sentiment Analysis:
"WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity" served as my dataset. Later, as seen in the paper "IITP at EmoInt-2017: Measuring Intensity of Emotions Using Sentence Embeddings and Optimized Features," data cleaning and feature extraction from various lexicons were performed. When the final train data was developed, it was used to create a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis.
