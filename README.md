### Text Generation, POS Tagging, Similar Word Prediction and Lemma Identification (10th October 2022 to 28th November 2022):
Under this context, I carried out data exploration besides computing Heap's and Zeph's law on a corpus of Hindi and English. By developing an automatic tagger and   word2Vec model which was used to generate text, POS, and Word Lemma tags followed by extrinsic evaluation.

### Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier (3rd December 2022 to 29th December 2022):
"WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity" served as my dataset. Later, as seen in the paper "IITP at EmoInt-2017: Measuring Intensity of Emotions Using Sentence Embeddings and Optimized Features," data cleaning and feature extraction from various lexicons were performed. When the final train data was developed, it was used to create a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis.
